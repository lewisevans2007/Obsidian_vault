C is a programming language that was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is a general-purpose programming language that is used for developing operating systems, compilers, and other applications. It is a procedural language, which means that it follows a sequence of instructions, and it is compiled, which means that it is translated into [[machine code]] before it is run.
