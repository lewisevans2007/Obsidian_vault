#python

In [[Python]] numbers are stored in numeric types. There are three numeric types in python:

- `int` - [[Integer]]
- `float` - [[Float]]
- `complex` - Complex

You will rarely use complex numbers, so we will focus on integers and floats.

## Example

```python
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
```
