NPM (Node Package Manager) is a powerful package manager for [[Node.js]], the popular [[JavaScript]] runtime environment. It comes bundled with Node.js and is the default package manager for the Node.js ecosystem. NPM enables developers to easily install, manage, and share reusable code packages, making it an essential tool for building Node.js applications.
### Package Management

NPM provides a vast repository of open-source JavaScript packages and libraries, which developers can easily search, install, and use in their projects. These packages contain reusable code, modules, and dependencies, saving developers time and effort when building applications.

### Version Management

NPM allows developers to specify package dependencies and versions in the [[package.json]] file. This enables project consistency and helps avoid compatibility issues when collaborating with other developers. NPM also provides tools for updating packages and managing version ranges.

### Command-line Interface

NPM offers a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that simplifies package management tasks. Developers can use the CLI to install packages, update dependencies, publish packages, and execute custom scripts defined in the [[package.json]] file.

### Semantic Versioning

NPM follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer), a versioning system that helps maintain compatibility and provides a clear indication of backward compatibility and breaking changes. This ensures that developers can confidently update packages without introducing unexpected errors.

### Private Package Hosting

NPM supports private package hosting, allowing organizations and developers to keep sensitive or proprietary code within their own ecosystem. This feature encourages code sharing within teams while maintaining control over access and security.
