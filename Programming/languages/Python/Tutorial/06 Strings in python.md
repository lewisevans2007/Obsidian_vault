#python

In [[python]] a [[string]] is a datatype that is used to store text. Strings are surrounded by either single or double quotes.

```python
a = "Hello World"
b = 'Hello World'
```

You can define string as multi lines by using three single or double quotes.

```python
a = """Hello
World"""
b = '''Hello
World'''
```

Functions that accept strings as arguments like `print()` can also accept variables that contain strings.

```python
a = "Hello World"
print(a)
```

```
> python main.py
Hello World
```
