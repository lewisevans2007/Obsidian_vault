A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a computer system that allows you to run multiple operating systems or instances of an operating system on a single physical machine. Here are some commonly used virtual machine programs and operating systems:

Virtual Machine Programs:
1. [[VMware Workstation]]: A popular virtualization program that enables the creation and management of virtual machines. It supports various operating systems and offers advanced features for testing, development, and production environments.
2. Oracle VM [[VirtualBox]]: A free and open-source virtualization platform that allows the creation and running of virtual machines on a host system. It supports a wide range of operating systems and provides features like snapshotting and guest additions.
3. Microsoft [[Hyper-V]]: A native hypervisor included with Windows that enables the creation and management of virtual machines. It is commonly used for server virtualization and is available on Windows Server and Windows 10 Pro.
4. [[KVM]] (Kernel-based Virtual Machine): A Linux-based hypervisor that allows the creation and management of virtual machines on Linux systems. It is a component of the Linux kernel and offers excellent performance and scalability.
5. [[Parallels]] Desktop: A virtualization program designed for macOS that allows running Windows, Linux, and other operating systems concurrently on a Mac system.

Operating Systems for Virtual Machines:
1. [[Windows]]: Microsoft Windows operating systems, including various editions such as Windows 10, Windows Server, and older versions like Windows 7 or Windows XP.
2. [[Linux]]: Numerous Linux distributions can be run on virtual machines, such as Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE.
3. [[macOS]]: Virtual machines can host macOS, allowing users to run multiple macOS instances on non-Apple hardware.
4. [[BSD]]: Operating systems like FreeBSD and OpenBSD can be virtualized for development or server purposes.
5. [[Unix]]: Variants of Unix, such as Solaris and AIX, can be run on virtual machines for testing or legacy application support.
