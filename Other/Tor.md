Tor, short for "The Onion Router," is a free and open-source [[network]]designed to provide online anonymity and privacy to users. It operates by routing internet [[traffic]] through a worldwide [[network]]of volunteer-run servers called nodes or relays. These nodes pass the data along a series of encrypted connections, making it challenging to trace back to the original source.
