DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a network management protocol commonly used to automatically assign [[IP addresses]] and other network configuration settings to devices on a network. DHCP enables devices like computers, smartphones, printers, and other network-enabled devices to connect to a network and obtain the necessary information to communicate with other devices and access the internet.
