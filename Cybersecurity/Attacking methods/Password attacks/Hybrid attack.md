A hybrid attack combines elements of both dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks. It starts with a dictionary attack using a list of common passwords and then extends to brute-force attempts, trying various permutations and combinations of characters to crack passwords that are not found in the dictionary. Hybrid attacks aim to strike a balance between efficiency and comprehensiveness, making them a popular choice for attacking passwords.
