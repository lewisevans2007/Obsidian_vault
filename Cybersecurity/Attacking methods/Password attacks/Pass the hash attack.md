In a pass the hash attack, the attacker captures the hashed password (rather than cracking it) from a compromised system. They then reuse this hashed value to authenticate themselves to other systems without needing the actual plaintext password. This technique is effective against systems where the same password is used for multiple accounts or services. Implementing strong password hashing algorithms and using unique passwords for each service can help mitigate pass the hash attacks.
