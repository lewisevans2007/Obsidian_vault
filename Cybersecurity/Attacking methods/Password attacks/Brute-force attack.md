A brute-force attack is a straightforward and exhaustive method of trying every possible combination of characters to crack a password or find a cryptographic key. The attacker systematically attempts all possible passwords until the correct one is discovered. While this method is simple, it can be extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for long and complex passwords. Brute-force attacks are often used as a last resort when other, more sophisticated attacks fail or when the password's strength is suspected to be weak.
