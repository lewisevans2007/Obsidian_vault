A rainbow table attack is a time-memory trade-off technique used to crack hashed passwords. It involves precomputing and storing a large table (the rainbow table) that contains pairs of hashes and their corresponding plaintext passwords. When attacking hashed passwords, the attacker looks up the hash in the rainbow table to find the original plaintext password. To mitigate rainbow table attacks, the use of salting (adding random data to the password before hashing) is commonly employed, making the precomputed tables ineffective.
