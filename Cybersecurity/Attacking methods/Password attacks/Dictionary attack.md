In a dictionary attack, the attacker uses a list of commonly used passwords, words from dictionaries, or known passwords leaked from previous data breaches to attempt to gain unauthorized access. This method is more efficient than a brute-force attack since it only tries a finite set of likely passwords. A dictionary attack is particularly effective against users who use easily guessable passwords or fail to follow best practices for password security.
