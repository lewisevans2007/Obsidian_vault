A credential stuffing attack is an automated method where attackers use large sets of username and password pairs (often obtained from previous data breaches) to gain unauthorized access to multiple accounts on various platforms. Since many users reuse passwords across multiple sites, credential stuffing attacks rely on exploiting this behavior. Implementing multi-factor authentication and encouraging users to adopt unique passwords for each service are essential countermeasures against credential stuffing attacks.
