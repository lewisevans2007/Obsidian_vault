A password spraying attack is similar to a brute-force attack but with a more targeted approach. Instead of trying every possible password for a single user account, the attacker attempts a small set of commonly used passwords against multiple user accounts. This method helps avoid detection by account lockout mechanisms, as it appears as legitimate login attempts. To protect against password spraying attacks, organizations should enforce strong password policies, implement account lockout policies, and monitor for unusual login patterns.
