Metasploit is a powerful and widely-used penetration testing framework that allows security professionals, ethical hackers, and [[cybersecurity]] researchers to assess the security of computer systems, networks, and applications. It provides a set of tools, known as modules, that help identify [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]], exploit them, and generate detailed reports on the security weaknesses found during the testing process. It is used on [[Linux]] operating systems especially [[Kali Linux]]
