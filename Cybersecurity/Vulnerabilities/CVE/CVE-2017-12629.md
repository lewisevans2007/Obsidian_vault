This vulnerability affects [[Apache]] CouchDB versions prior to 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by exploiting a flaw in the [[database]] software.

## Example
The vulnerability is related to the way CouchDB handles [[JSON]] input. An attacker can send a malicious [[JSON]] document in a [[POST]] request like the following:

```json
{
  "_id": { "$gt": "0" },
  "name": "attacker",
  "password": { "$gt": "0" }
}
```

When CouchDB processes this document and constructs the underlying [[SQL]] query, it may end up executing a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE _id > '0' AND name = 'attacker' AND password > '0';
```

This could lead to unintended consequences like leaking sensitive data or even unauthorized access.
