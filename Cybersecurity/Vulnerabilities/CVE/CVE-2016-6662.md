This vulnerability was found in [[MySQL]] versions 5.5.51, 5.6.x before 5.6.32, and 5.7.x before 5.7.14. It allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary [[SQL]] commands via a crafted string that was not properly sanitized before being used in a [[SQL]] query.

## Example
The issue was due to the mishandling of user-supplied data in a prepared statement. For example:

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);

String username = getRequestParameter("username");
String password = getRequestParameter("password");

stmt.setString(1, username);
stmt.setString(2, password);

ResultSet result = stmt.executeQuery();
```

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing malicious input for the username and password parameters. For instance, if the attacker sets the "username" parameter to `"admin'--"` and the "password" parameter to anything, the generated query would become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = 'anything';
```

The double dash `--` is a [[SQL]] comment, which effectively ignores the rest of the query, allowing the attacker to bypass the password check and potentially gain unauthorized access.
