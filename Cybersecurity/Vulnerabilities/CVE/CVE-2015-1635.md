#Microsoft 
This [[vulnerability]] exists in [[Microsoft]] Internet Information Services (IIS) when handling [[HTTP]] requests. An attacker can exploit it to execute arbitrary [[SQL]] commands due to improper validation of user-supplied input.

## Example
Let's assume there is a web application that accepts user input to search for a specific product by its ID. The vulnerable [[SQL]] query might look like this (insecure code):

```sql
productId = getRequestParameter("product_id");
query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = " + productId;
```

An attacker can craft a malicious input such as `productId = "1 OR 1=1"` which, when appended to the query, will become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1;
```

This will always return all rows from the "products" table because `1=1` is always true, effectively bypassing the intended query.
