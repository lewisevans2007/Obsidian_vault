Improper Authentication - This CWE encompasses various weaknesses related to inadequate or flawed authentication mechanisms.
Example (Node.js):
```javascript
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const username = req.body.username;
    const password = req.body.password;
    if (username === "admin" && password === "secretpassword") {
        // Allow access...
    } else {
        // Deny access...
   }
   // Vulnerability: The hardcoded credentials make the authentication mechanism weak.
});
```
