[[Out-of-bounds]] Read - This weakness occurs when a program reads data beyond the bounds of an allocated memory buffer.

## Example (C++)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::cout << array[10]; // Vulnerability: Accessing beyond the bounds of the array.
    return 0;
}
```
