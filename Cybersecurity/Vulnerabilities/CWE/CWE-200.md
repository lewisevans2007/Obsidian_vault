Information Exposure - This weakness occurs when sensitive information is exposed to unintended parties due to improper handling or security misconfigurations.

## Example (Python)
```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    if username == "admin" and password == "secretpassword":
        return True
    else:
        return False
    # Vulnerability: The hardcoded password in the code exposes sensitive information.
```
