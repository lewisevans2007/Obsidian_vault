Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - This weakness refers to [[Buffer overflow]] [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] , where data is written beyond the allocated memory buffer's boundaries, leading to potential code execution or information disclosure.

## Example (C/C++)

```c
void copyData(char* source) {
    char destination[10];
    strcpy(destination, source); // Vulnerability: if the source is larger than the destination buffer, it overflows.
}
```
