#malware

Adware is a type of [[malware]] that displays unwanted advertisements on your computer. Adware programs are often built into [[freeware]] or [[shareware]] programs, where the adware creates an indirect ‘charge’ for using the free program. Adware can slow down your PC. Adware can also slow down your Internet connection by downloading advertisements. In addition, adware can increase the instability of your system because many adware applications are not programmed well.

Adware is often flagged by [[antivirus]] programs as a [[potentially unwanted program]] (PUP).
