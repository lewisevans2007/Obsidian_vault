OpenCandy was a controversial advertising software module that was often bundled with various free software applications. Its purpose was to offer users additional software recommendations during the installation process of the main software. While some considered it adware due to its advertising behavior, OpenCandy's creators argued that it was not malicious and offered users the choice to accept or decline the suggested software. However, it received criticism from the security community for its potentially deceptive bundling practices. OpenCandy became a subject of concern as it raised questions about users' consent and transparency in software bundling practices.
