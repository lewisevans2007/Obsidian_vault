**Vonteera**, also known as OSX/Vonteera, was a type of adware that specifically targeted [[macOS]] users. It was designed to display intrusive advertisements, alter browser settings, and collect user information without proper consent. Vonteera often spread through deceptive software installers and fake updates, exploiting users' trust in seemingly legitimate sources. Its activities were considered unwanted and harmful, leading to performance issues and compromised privacy on infected systems. Security researchers and antivirus vendors worked to detect and remove Vonteera to protect macOS users from its disruptive adware behavior.
