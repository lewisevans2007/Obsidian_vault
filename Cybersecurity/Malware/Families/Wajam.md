Wajam was a social search and adware application that claimed to enhance users' search experience by providing personalized search results based on their social media activities. It integrated with major search engines like [[Google]] and [[Bing]] to display recommended links and posts shared by friends. While some users found Wajam useful, it faced criticism for its intrusive behavior and privacy concerns. Wajam collected users' browsing habits and social media data to deliver targeted advertisements, which raised privacy issues among users and security experts. As a result, Wajam was classified as a [[potentially unwanted program]] (PUP) and was often flagged by security software for removal.
