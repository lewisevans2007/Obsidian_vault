Eorezo is a [[potentially unwanted program]] (PUP) or [[adware]] that was known for causing unwanted pop-up advertisements and browser redirects. It was often distributed through software bundling, where it was packaged with legitimate software downloads. Once installed on a system, Eorezo would display intrusive ads, inject advertisements into web pages, and modify browser settings without the user's consent. Eorezo's activities were considered intrusive and disruptive to the user's browsing experience. Due to its adware behavior, Eorezo was flagged by reputable antivirus and anti-malware programs, and its removal was recommended to restore the system's performance and protect user privacy.
