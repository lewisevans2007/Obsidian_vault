njRAT is a remote access Trojan ([[RAT]]) that has been used as a tool for unauthorized remote administration on compromised systems. Here's an overview of what njRAT is and how it operates:

1. Infiltration:
   - njRAT typically enters a system through social engineering techniques, such as malicious email attachments, software downloads from untrusted sources, or drive-by downloads from infected websites.
   - Once executed on a system, njRAT attempts to establish persistence by creating startup entries or modifying system settings.

2. Remote Control:
   - Upon successful installation, njRAT establishes a command-and-control (C2) connection with a remote attacker-controlled server.
   - This connection allows the attacker to gain unauthorized remote control over the infected system.

3. Key Features:
   - File Operations: njRAT enables the attacker to browse, upload, download, and execute files on the compromised system.
   - Remote Desktop: The RAT provides the capability to view and control the victim's desktop in real-time.
   - Surveillance: njRAT can activate the system's webcam and microphone to monitor the victim's activities.
   - Keystroke Logging: It can capture and transmit keystrokes, enabling the attacker to record sensitive information, such as login credentials.
   - Password Stealing: njRAT includes modules designed to extract stored passwords from web browsers, [[FTP]] clients, and other applications.
   - Distributed Denial of Service ([[DDoS]]): Some versions of njRAT incorporate [[DDoS]] capabilities, allowing the attacker to launch coordinated attacks on targeted websites or systems.

4. Anti-Detection Techniques:
   - njRAT employs various techniques to avoid detection by security software.
   - It can modify its own binary code, use process injection to hide its presence within legitimate processes, and employ encryption to obfuscate its [[network]][[traffic]].

5. Spread and Propagation:
   - njRAT can spread itself to other systems within the same [[network]]or external systems by exploiting [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] or using social engineering techniques.
   - It may also be distributed by attackers through malicious email attachments or disguised as legitimate software downloads.
