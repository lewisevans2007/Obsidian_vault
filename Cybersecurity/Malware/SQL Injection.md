Exploiting [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] in a website's [[database]] to execute unauthorized [[SQL]] commands.

## Examples

A SQL injection needs to be done in a form field that is connected to a database. For example, a login form that is connected to a database. The SQL injection is done in the username or password field.

### Example using a URL parameter

In this example we are going to use a URL parameter to do a SQL injection. The URL parameter is `username` and `password`. The URL is `example.com/login?username=John&password=1234`. The SQL injection is done in the `username` and `password` parameter.

Url with normal parameters:
```
example.com/login?username=John&password=1234
```

Sql code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' AND password = '1234'
```

Url with SQL injection:
```
example.com/login?username=John' OR '1'='1&password=1234
```

Sql code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' OR '1'='1' AND password = '1234'
```

### Example using a form field

In this example we are going to use a form field to do a SQL injection. The form field is `username` and `password`. The form is `example.com/login`. The SQL injection is done in the `username` and `password` field.

Form with normal parameters:
```html
<form action="example.com/login" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" value="John">
    <input type="password" name="password" value="1234">
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>

```

sql code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' AND password = '1234'
```

Form with SQL injection:
```html
<form action="example.com/login" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" value="John' OR '1'='1">
    <input type="password" name="password" value="1234">
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>

```

sql code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' OR '1'='1' AND password = '1234'
```

## SQL injection types

### Error based SQL injection

Error based SQL injection is a type of SQL injection that uses error messages to get information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used when the website does not show any information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used to get information from the database.

### Union based SQL injection

Union based SQL injection is a type of SQL injection that uses the `UNION` command to get information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used when the website shows information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used to get information from the database.

### Blind SQL injection

Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL injection that uses boolean logic to get information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used when the website does not show any information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used to get information from the database.

### Time based SQL injection

Time based SQL injection is a type of SQL injection that uses time delays to get information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used when the website does not show any information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used to get information from the database.

### Out of band SQL injection

Out of band SQL injection is a type of SQL injection that uses a different channel to get information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used when the website does not show any information from the database. This type of SQL injection is used to get information from the database.
