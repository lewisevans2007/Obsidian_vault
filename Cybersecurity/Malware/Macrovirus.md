#malware

A [[macro]] virus is a type of [[malware]] that uses [[macro|macros]] to infect a computer. This is usually done by embedding the macro into a document, such as a [[Microsoft Word]] document. When the document is opened, the macro is executed, and the virus is installed. Malware like [[Emotet]] and [[Trickbot]] are often distributed this way.
