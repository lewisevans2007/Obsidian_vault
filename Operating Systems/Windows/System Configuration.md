The System Configuration page in Windows is a utility that allows you to manage various start up and system settings on your computer. It provides a centralized location to modify settings that can impact the way your computer boots up and functions.

## Pages in system configuration
1. General: This tab allows you to choose the startup configuration for your computer, including options such as Normal startup, Diagnostic startup, and Selective startup.
2. Boot: Here, you can modify boot options like adding or removing operating systems from the boot menu, setting the timeout duration, or specifying the default operating system.
3. Services: This tab lists all the services that start with Windows. You can enable or disable services selectively, helping to troubleshoot startup issues or improve system performance.
4. Startup: This tab displays a list of programs that launch automatically when your computer starts up. You can enable or disable individual programs from starting up during boot.
5. Tools: This tab provides quick access to additional system tools such as Event Viewer, Task Manager, and Computer Management.
