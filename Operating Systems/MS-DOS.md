MS-DOS (Microsoft disk operating system) is a operating system by [[Microsoft]] that was used with very old versions of [[Windows]] such as [[Windows 3.1]], [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98]]. A user would use [[Floppy Disks]] to load data onto the system. Modern version's of windows like [[Windows 10]] and [[Windows 11]] still use a similar system to MS-DOS
