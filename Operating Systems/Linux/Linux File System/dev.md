The dev folder contains special device files for devices that are attached to the system.

Here is what the dev folder contains on ISH for iOS.
```
clipboard  pts        tty4
console    random     tty5
full       tty        tty6
location   tty1       tty7
null       tty2       urandom
ptmx       tty3       zero
```

Here you can see the TTY device files and other files needed by the system.
