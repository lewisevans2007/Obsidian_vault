`gid_t` stands for "group ID type." It is a data type used in the [[Linux]] kernel and [[C]] library to represent group IDs (GIDs). A GID is a unique identifier assigned to each group in the Linux operating system. Groups are used to organize users, allowing multiple users to share common access rights and permissions to files and resources.

In the Linux kernel, `gid_t` is defined as an unsigned [[integer]] type (usually 32 bits) and is commonly used in various kernel functions and data structures to represent group IDs. User-space programs and the kernel use `gid_t` to identify groups and determine group-based access rights to files and other system resources.
