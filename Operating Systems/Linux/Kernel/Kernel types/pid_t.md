`pid_t` stands for "process ID type." It is a data type used in the [[Linux]] kernel and [[C]] library to represent process IDs ([[PID]]s). The [[PID]] serves as a handle or reference to a specific process, allowing the system and user-space programs to interact with and manage processes effectively.

In the Linux kernel, `pid_t` is defined as a signed [[integer]] type (usually 32 bits) and is commonly used in various kernel functions and data structures to represent process IDs. The PID values themselves are assigned and managed by the kernel and are not meant to be interpreted or manipulated directly by user-space programs.
