`time_t` is a data type used in the [[C]] language and widely utilized in the [[Linux]] kernel and other operating systems. It represents a point in time and is used to store timestamps, specifically the number of seconds elapsed since the [[Unix Epoch]]. The Unix Epoch is defined as January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

In the [[Linux]] kernel, `time_t` is typically defined as a signed integer type, representing the number of seconds since the Epoch. The actual size of `time_t` depends on the architecture and compilation environment. On most systems, `time_t` is a 32-bit or 64-bit signed [[integer]].
