`off_t` stands for "offset type." It is a data type used in the [[Linux]] kernel and [[C]] library to represent file offsets. A file offset is a numeric value that represents a position within a file where read and write operations can take place. It indicates the position in the file from which the next read or write operation will occur.

In the Linux kernel, `off_t` is typically defined as a signed [[integer]] data type, and its size depends on the architecture and compilation environment. For example, on 32-bit systems, `off_t` is typically a 32-bit signed integer, while on 64-bit systems, it is a 64-bit signed integer to accommodate larger file sizes.
