`dev_t` is a data type used in the [[C]] language and commonly used in the [[Linux]] kernel and other operating systems. It stands for "device type" and is used to represent device numbers. In the context of the Linux kernel, a device number is a unique identifier assigned to each device registered with the system, such as disk drives, serial ports, or network interfaces.

In the [[Linux]] kernel, `dev_t` is typically an [[integer]] type, and its size depends on the architecture and configuration. It consists of two components: the major number and the minor number. The major number identifies the device driver associated with the device, while the minor number is used to distinguish between different instances of devices managed by the same driver.
