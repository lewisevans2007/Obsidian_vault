`size_t` is a data type used in the [[C]] language and widely adopted in the [[Linux]] kernel and other software development environments. It represents an unsigned integer type, typically used to represent the size of objects in memory. The `size_t` data type is designed to be large enough to hold the size of the largest possible object that can be allocated on the system.

In the [[Linux]] kernel, `size_t` is commonly used in various contexts where object sizes, buffer sizes, or memory allocations need to be represented. It is especially important in low-level systems programming tasks, such as memory management, buffer handling, and [[array]] indexing.
