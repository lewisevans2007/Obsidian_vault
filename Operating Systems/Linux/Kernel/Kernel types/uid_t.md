`uid_t` stands for "user ID type." It is a data type used in the [[Linux]] kernel and [[C]] library to represent user IDs (UIDs). A [[UID]] is a unique identifier assigned to each user account in the Linux operating system. The UID is an integer value used by the system to associate specific privileges, permissions, and ownership rights with each user.

In the Linux kernel, `uid_t` is defined as an unsigned [[integer]] type (usually 32 bits) and is commonly used in various kernel functions and data structures to represent user IDs. User-space programs and the kernel use `uid_t` to identify users and determine their access rights to various resources and files,
