`mode_t` is a data type used in the [[C]] language and commonly used in the [[Linux]] kernel and other operating systems. It stands for "mode type" and is used to represent file permission modes. In the context of the Linux filesystem, file permission modes determine the access rights that users and groups have for a particular file or directory.

The `mode_t` data type is an [[integer]] type, and its size depends on the architecture and configuration. Typically, it is a 16-bit or 32-bit integer, depending on the system.
