`ssize_t` is a data type used in the [[C]] language and commonly used in the [[Linux]] kernel and other software development environments. It stands for "signed size type" and is used to represent the sizes of objects in memory, similar to [[size_t]]. However, `ssize_t` is a signed [[integer]] type, whereas `size_t` is an unsigned integer type.

The primary purpose of `ssize_t` is to provide a data type that can represent both the size of objects and certain error conditions. When a function returns a `ssize_t` value, a positive value represents the size of the object, and a negative value typically indicates an error occurred. Zero may be used to indicate that the operation succeeded but the size of the object is zero.

In the Linux kernel, `ssize_t` is widely used in situations where functions need to return the size of a data object, and it provides a convenient way to handle errors and success conditions.
