This function initializes the rest of the kernel after the basic subsystems have been initialized by [[start_kernel]] . It spawns the init process ([[PID]] 1) and waits for it to complete its initialization.
## Code
```c
noinline void __ref __noreturn rest_init(void)
{
	struct task_struct *tsk;
	int pid;

	rcu_scheduler_starting();
	/*
	 * We need to spawn init first so that it obtains pid 1, however
	 * the init task will end up wanting to create kthreads, which, if
	 * we schedule it before we create kthreadd, will OOPS.
	 */
	pid = user_mode_thread(kernel_init, NULL, CLONE_FS);
	/*
	 * Pin init on the boot CPU. Task migration is not properly working
	 * until sched_init_smp() has been run. It will set the allowed
	 * CPUs for init to the non isolated CPUs.
	 */
	rcu_read_lock();
	tsk = find_task_by_pid_ns(pid, &init_pid_ns);
	tsk->flags |= PF_NO_SETAFFINITY;
	set_cpus_allowed_ptr(tsk, cpumask_of(smp_processor_id()));
	rcu_read_unlock();

	numa_default_policy();
	pid = kernel_thread(kthreadd, NULL, NULL, CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES);
	rcu_read_lock();
	kthreadd_task = find_task_by_pid_ns(pid, &init_pid_ns);
	rcu_read_unlock();

	/*
	 * Enable might_sleep() and smp_processor_id() checks.
	 * They cannot be enabled earlier because with CONFIG_PREEMPTION=y
	 * kernel_thread() would trigger might_sleep() splats. With
	 * CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y the init task might have scheduled
	 * already, but it's stuck on the kthreadd_done completion.
	 */
	system_state = SYSTEM_SCHEDULING;

	complete(&kthreadd_done);

	/*
	 * The boot idle thread must execute schedule()
	 * at least once to get things moving:
	 */
